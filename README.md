# pbzip2

This package provides parallel and streaming decompression of bzip2 files. It
operates by scanning the file to find each independent bzip2 block and then
uses a modified version of `compress/bzip2` to decompress each block. The
decompressed blocks are then reassembled into their original order and made
available as a stream (via io.Readere).

The scanner identifies blocks by searching for the magic numbers that denote
the start of a block and the end of the file. Consequently it will be fooled
if these 6 byte sequences occur in the compressed data but the probability of
this happening is obviously very low and even if it were to happen the block decompressor
would error out with a failed CRC check. This case could be handled by
adding support for ignoring specific instances of the magic numbers, but for
now, the assumption is made that this is rare enough to be safely ignored.

There are three components to this package:
1. the scanner
2. the parallel decompressor
3. the modified bzip2 package

The scanner operates as described above but its implementation is complicated
by the fact that bzip blocks are bit aligned. The search for the bzip block
magic number is therefore implemented using two lookup tables of 32 bit ints
that contain all possible patterns that the 6 byte magic numbers could occur
as allowing for them to be shifted 1..7 bits in the stream.

The parallel decompressor accepts requests to decompress each bzip2 block
concurrently and then reassembles them into a stream allowing for incremental
processing of the decompressed data. The decompressor uses a modified
version of the go builtin compress/bzip2 package to decompress each block
separately. Fortunately those modifictions are straight forward.

So long as the scanning portion is faster than the decompression by some
reasonable factor, and it is run on a multi-core machine, then this approach
will be significantly faster than a serial bzip2 decompressor. Given the coarse
nature of the operations it should scale linearly with the number of cores
available to it. In simple testing using the wikidata entities downloads
(`https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/20191202/wikidata-20191202-all.json.bz2`)
it does indeed appear to be 8 times faster than the serial version on an 8
core machine.
